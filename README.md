# Movies_in_Box_Office_and_their_Analysis
My personal dissertation as of the year 2023-2024 where I passed and also is in greek (I cannot simply change the whole project and translate it as it is around 10000 words plus some extras like a presentation and a poster).Basically my project was predicting the perchentage of success of movies who belong to Box office based on some factors like the budget of the movie, the audience attracted by the movie etc....in combination with Machine Learning on MATLAB and of course Data Mining and Data Analysis. It was not the easiest task at hand but with a little effort and motivation the project was completed right on time before the deadline.
